The unspoken implication: fire those pesky programmers and replace them with an API call. AI acolytes believe that all software development, indeed all knowledge work, is about to become obsolete; skeptics are convinced that over a trillion dollars have been wasted and a dot-com style collapse is imminent. All roads, it seems, lead to mass unemployment and a takeover by skynet.</p><!--more--><p>Never a confident bunch, senior engineers are worried about a rapid devaluation of skills that were acquired over a lifetime. Worryingly, enrollment in undergraduate and graduate courses has decreased. If one can “vibe-code” software, then it’s just a matter of wishing the AI genie to solve problems. Learning is a fool’s errand. So greater unemployment, fewer apprentices to the art of software development, and rapid loss in institutional understanding of complex human spaces — all being cheered on by ungodly sums of VC money!</p><p>What is conspicuous by its absence is meaningful conversation about societal good!</p><p>The roughly dozen folks at <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2023-12-12-launch.html">Answer.AI</a>, led by Jeremy Howard and Eric Ries, are making a contrarian bet: what is needed most in this moment is a return to curiosity — a return to craftsmanship. They believe that what AI affords is the ability to cut deeply through layers of complexity. There is an affortable opportunity for humans to comprehend machine-scale systems. Their answer: a generalized compute platform called <a href="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.html">SolveIt</a> that integrates AI with literate programming.</p><p>Roman coins minted in the time of Emperor Augustus bore the emblem of the dolphin and anchor, symbolizing “festina lente” — make haste slowly. You may know the modern adage: “slow is smooth and smooth is fast.” SolveIt is a platform that enables iteratively solving problems while pair programming with an LLM. One step at a time. Named after a problem-solving method from the mathematician George Pólya<span class="marginnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It">How to Solve It</a>, 1945</span>, SolveIt feels like an evolution of Jupyter notebooks (which allow exploration by combining code, data, and notes into a living document). In a marked departure from the “vibe-coding” tools, SolveIt (by design) slows down thinking and encourages exploration as the software is built.</p><p>By pure serendipity, the enrollment deadline for the second SolveIt cohort was about a week after I quit my job (my first break in about 25 years!). Having missed Jeremy Howard’s previous courses, signing up was a no-brainer. There is something immediately different about this course. A few hundred folks from various timezones are on. The sessions are unpolished; perhaps the lack of gloss is the point. There’s shared curiosity, almost like we just ran a chemistry experiment and are waiting for purple smoke from the beaker. And there was so much attention to detail — and kindness. Howard and Johno Whitaker run through problems from Advent of Code. A longtime skeptic of leetcode-style challenges, I had written these off. But suddenly the puzzles are fun. Taking a problem, breaking it down into the smallest elements, and building it back up — I feel more like a traveller and less like a tourist.</p><p>And then the sessions traverse large distances. In sessions lasting roughly an hour (it is too much fun to mind the clock) we deeply explore how agents like Claude work. Building them from scratch. We set up cheap infrastructure outside the popular hyperscalers. We dip into linear algebra. I was never good at this, but suddenly I’m building intuition about matrix math. Eric jumps on and talks about harsh realities of the business side that plague innovators. Skills I previously assumed were the domain of polymaths and giants feel accessible. It has been years since I had written code, but like most managers, I did not start my career because of a deep love of managing managers of software engineers. Yes, this is work, but it is fun to be programming again.</p><p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei writes, “Humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.”<span class="marginnote"><a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace">Machines of Loving Grace</a>, Dario Amodei, 2024</span> Perhaps Amodei is right. A few minutes on LinkedIn will tell you that you are obsolete and your peers have already solved all meaningful problems. AI skeptics will call LLMs a farce. Regardless, neither offer a path for the motivated and skilled (and likely terrified).</p><p>As a profession, coders experience high levels of imposter syndrome. The antidote isn’t more AI - it’s more human agency. When engineers approach problems with genuine curiosity rather than a rush to ship, they build systems they actually understand. Craftsmanship means taking small, deliberate steps—breaking every hard problem into pieces small enough to hold in your head. This produces maintainable code because you can’t maintain what you never understood. It rebuilds confidence because imposter syndrome thrives on mystery, and curiosity dissolves mystery. The engineer who asks “why does this work?” doesn’t need the help of magical incantations.</p><p>Reject the noise. There are real problems waiting in the world.</p><hr><p><a href="/articles">← Back to all articles</a></p></article></main><div class="bottom-footer"> <span class="mini-note">You can contact me at: <a href="mailto:comments@chandru.blog">comments@chandru.blog</a></span></div><script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> MathJax.Hub.Config({ extensions: ["tex2jax.js", "TeX/AMSmath.js"], jax: ["input/TeX", "output/SVG"], }) </script> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.6/MathJax.js?config=default"> </script>
