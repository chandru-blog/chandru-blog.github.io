This blog is created using jekyll and is hosted for free on GitHub pages. It uses Bradley Taunt’s <a href="https://github.com/bradleytaunt/ET-Jekyll">ET-Jekyll</a> theme.</p><!--more--><p>Rachel Thomas has an extremely well-written post on <a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045">why you should blog</a>.</p><h2 id="you-should-probably-not-self-host">You should probably not self-host</h2><p>It is fun to setup software and host your own blog. In 2024, setting up wordpress is a commoditized skill. Self-hosting work is a fun procrastination. It will not make your writing better.</p><blockquote><p>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.<span class="marginnote">Clear, James. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/taking-action"><em>Taking Action.</em></a> jamesclear.com, 20 Jan. 2020.</span></p></blockquote><p>You should focus on publishing content.</p><h2 id="you-should-probably-not-use-medium">You should probably not use medium</h2><p>Medium is a paywalled online publishing platform for reading authored articles. It is a marketplace for authors to publish content and get paid for it. My goal is to publish content - I don’t want people to pay for information that I would gladly give them.</p><p>At this stage of my career, I find less need for public addulation. I also don’t want to build a large following that I can monetize. My preference is contempt-free, nuanced, and respectful conversation. Drop me a note at <a href="mailto:comments@chandru.blog">comments@chandru.blog</a></p><h2 id="you-should-host-on-github-pages">You should host on github pages</h2><p>Github is easy to setup, the limits are reasonable, and it is free. Paying companies depend on GitHub so it is well maintained and monitored.</p><p>In essence, GitHub pages is a specially named public git repository. Any markdown content in this repo will be rendered automatically by GitHub. Markdown takes away the temptation to tinker with typography and layout.</p><h2 id="you-should-use-jekyll">You should use jekyll</h2><p>Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes markdown pages and renders them into static html. Once converted, these files can be hosted on any webserver (such as GitHub pages).</p><h2 id="you-shoud-do-the-jekyll-tutorial">You shoud do the jekyll tutorial</h2><p>Doing tutorials feels tedious. But a few minutes spent on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">this tutorial</a> will give you an understanding of the terrain; it will make your journey easier.</p><p>If you aren’t familiar with the ruby ecosystem, I would suggest that you understand common commands for the ruby package manager, <a href="https://bundler.io"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle</code></a>.</p><h2 id="a-few-easy-steps">A few easy steps</h2><p>I assume that you have a basic understanding of git and GitHub. The git cli is powerful but I tend to use <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a> for more complex operations.</p><h3 id="setup-github-pages">Setup GitHub Pages</h3><p>Excellent step by step documentation is available <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">GitHub docs</a>.</p><h3 id="repos">Repos</h3><p>GitHub has the ability to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll">detect jekyll configs and render</a> html for you. However, I prefer to locally render markdown into html and then push that out to GitHub.</p><p>I prefer to keep my working copy in a different repo than the GitHub pages. My workflow looks something like this:</p><ol><li>Use the working repo for authoring and generating content. Use git branching, merging, PRs for managing versions.<li>Generate the static content locally.<li>Merge into the GitHub pages repo and push content to publish.</ol><h3 id="optional-setup-a-custom-domain">Optional: setup a custom domain</h3><p>This is probably the most complex portion of all of the setup. But it is isn’t that difficult. The instructions on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">GitHub docs</a> are excellent.</p><hr><p><a href="/articles">← Back to all articles</a></p></article></main><div class="bottom-footer"> <span class="mini-note">You can contact me at: <a href="mailto:comments@chandru.blog">comments@chandru.blog</a></span></div><script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> MathJax.Hub.Config({ extensions: ["tex2jax.js", "TeX/AMSmath.js"], jax: ["input/TeX", "output/SVG"], }) </script> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.6/MathJax.js?config=default"> </script>
