It uses Bradley Taunt’s <a href="https://github.com/bradleytaunt/ET-Jekyll">ET-Jekyll</a> theme.</p><p>Setting up a blog is not difficult and you should create one. Rachel Thomas has an extremely well-written post on <a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045">why you should blog</a>.</p><h2 id="you-should-probably-not-self-host">You should probably not self-host</h2><p>It is fun to setup software and host your own blog. In 2024, setting up wordpress is a commoditized skill. Self-hosting work is a fun procrastination. It will not make your writing better.</p><blockquote><p>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.<span class="marginnote">Clear, James. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/taking-action"><em>Taking Action.</em></a> jamesclear.com, 20 Jan. 2020.</span></p></blockquote><p>You should focus on publishing content.</p><h2 id="you-should-probably-not-use-medium">You should probably not use medium</h2><p>Medium is a paywalled online publishing platform for reading authored articles. It is a marketplace for authors to publish content and get paid for it. My goal is to publish content - I don’t want people to pay for information that I would gladly give them.</p><p>At this stage of my career, I find less of a need for public addulation. I also don’t want to build a large following that I can monetize. I would rather have a nuanced and respectful conversation.

Paying companies depend on GitHub so it is well maintained and monitored.</p><p>In essence, GitHub pages is a specially named public git repository. Any markdown content in this repo will be rendered automatically by GitHub. Markdown takes away the temptation to tinker with typography and layout.</p><h2 id="a-few-easy-steps">A few easy steps</h2><p>I assume that you have a basic understanding of git and GitHub.
